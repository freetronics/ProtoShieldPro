A general-purpose prototyping shield for the Arduino Duemilanove,
TwentyTen and other compatible boards based on the same header format.

This design is intended to maximise prototyping area by extending the
plain pads right to the ends of the board, which also makes it easier
to fit horizontal PCB-mount sockets that need to overlap the edge.

Features:

 * Reset button wired through to Arduino reset pin.
 * Additional momentary button (output biased low by 10k resistor and
   pulled HIGH by the button).
 * Two general-purpose SMT LEDs (drive HIGH to illuminate).
 * 2 surface-mount 100nF 5V bypass/smoothing capacitors.
 * Overlay guide where you need it (both top and bottom)
